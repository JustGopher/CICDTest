# This is a basic workflow to help you get started with Actions

name: Go Lint

# Controls when the workflow will run
on:
  # Triggers the workflow on push or pull request events but only for the "master" branch
  push:
    branches: [ "master" ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ "master" ]

  # Allows you to run this workflow manually from the Actions tab
  workflow_dispatch:

# A workflow run is made up of one or more jobs that can run sequentially or in parallel
jobs:
  # This workflow contains a single job called "build"
  build:
    # The type of runner that the job will run on
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    # Steps represent a sequence of tasks that will be executed as part of the job
    steps:
      # 第一步：检出代码
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v4

      # 第二步：设置Go环境
      - name: Set up Go
        uses: actions/setup-go@v5
        # 设置Go版本，可以根据项目要求进行调整
        with:
          go-version: '1.19'

      # 第三步：安装依赖项
      - name: Install dependencies
        # 运行命令来下载项目的依赖项
        run: go mod download

      # 第四步：运行golangci-lint进行代码检查
      - name: Run golangci-lint
        # 执行代码检查命令
        run: golangci-lint run
          echo test, and deploy your project.
